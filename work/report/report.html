    <h2>S01</h2>
    <p>I have prior experience and feel experienced in GIT. I have been hosting a git-server since 2,5years and been
        the main code administrator during past projects. Of course I do not know everything but I have enough knowledge to
        find solutions to the more advanced problems when they arise.</p>

    <p>GitHub:<br>
        Yes, some experience. I also have som e experience using GitLab. Haven't used either of them that much due to
        I have been using my own git-server.</p>

    <p>Markdown:<br>
        I have only limited experience of markdown. I get around and know the basics but I do not know it by heart</p>

    <p>GitHub pages:<br>
        I have some previous experience with GitHub pages but only limited of the same reason as stated above.</p>

    <p>Creating web pages:<br>
        I do have some previous experience in creating websites. Both in pure HTML/Flash and in HTML/CSS/JS(React/TypeScript).
        As stated before, I have some knowledge but it's just the basics.</p>

    <p>I would describe my previous experience in web development as overall limited. I get things done but it takes some time
        and research due to lack of experience and knowledge. Why haven't I developed that much for web? The dynamic typing in
        JS is confusing for me that normally use C/C++ and Android/Java. And when working with UX/UI I often find myself
        lacking ideas for design.</p>

    <p>Today I learned about some new frameworks and techniques used for web-development. As I said before,
        its a jungle out there. And there is always something new...</p>

    <h2>S02</h2>
    <p>A short description of what makes a web page: HTML gives the page its structure, what goes where, where
        resources can be found etc.
        CSS fine-tunes how different elements of the page is visualised, interacts with other element and how they
        should respond to triggered events.
        Javascript provides dynamic to the page. Fetching of remote data, filtering data and calculations are some
        common implementations.</p>
    <p>I do have prior experience with HTML, JS and CSS but have lately used React.JS and Typescript to develop
        websites.
        On top of that I haven't really made any attempt to deep-dive into it. Web-development have always been an
        anxiety for me.
        I really do still experience confusion when it comes to web-development. It seems unstructured when compared to
        "normal"
        development.</p>
    <p>During this section I have been playing and debugging with CSS, both inline and in stylesheet. This work with
        CSS and JS has had the consequence
        that I have learned som new techniques to implement the desired effect on components.</p>
    <p>A short description of browser - HTTP - web server interaction:<br>
        A user request a web page via a browser. The browser connects to the web server via a HTTP GET. The web server
        looks
        for the resource specified in the GET from the browser. If found the web server responds to the browser with
        the requested data and the return code 200.
        Upon receiving the data (string of html) from web server the browser searches the received html for external
        resources referenced.
        The browser performs request for these resources and when all resources are locally(there are exceptions to
        this of course) the page will be showed fro the user</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>S03</h2>
    <p>As said before I consider my skills in JS to be basic at best. When it comes to actual code JS is ok but when it
        comes to the finer details like how data is stored, referenced and handled I tend to use the c/c++/java
        approach and I think there's a better way in JS that I need to find and learn.
    </p>
    <p>In all these exercises and for the course in general I aim for grade 5. I do acknowledge that my
        skill/experience in design is poor but I hope that my technical skill will be enough to reach my goal.
        For this section of the course I have used my own web-server (Bitnami/Apache/Tomcat) for testing of the fetch
        function. Me and a class-mate have been using this server earlier for testing in a react-project that we have
        as a pet project. On this server I have implement a CORS-filter so we don't face that problem when testing
        scripts. After I verified the functionality of fetching data from a web-api I switched to get the data from
        GitHub instead. For convenience.
        <br>
        As for the js/css/html during this section I have really tried to challenge myself. To sit with the code and
        make it work. Not googleing away for solutions at the slightest problem but try and try and read and try until
        a working solution is produced. By me. I wanted to test if I could "crack" the javascript enigma I was soo
        afraid of. And I must say it worked.
        A note on my solution: When I was converting my js for the plane (moving object) to object I thought was
        supposed to create a class definition. It was fun and result was ok. My friend spoke to you 31st of jan of my
        solution and according to him you said it was fine. I do know how to work with javascript object-literals.
        I have appended an additional script for the plane using only an object-literal
        (work/s03/js/plane.js). Not as fancy as the first one I did thou...</p>
    <p>TIL: For the first time I feel a little bit more comfortable with JS. Working with object and class definition
        gave me some insight into some dom-features
        and some pitfalls. For ex. the windows.setInterval() runs a function at set interval. Problem is that function
        seem to be invoked on a temporary obj.
        Due to this I had to rewrite the code to get a handle on the object I wanted to handle. There's probably a more
        correct way of doing this but now it works. I will continue try different solutions. <br>
        As for CSS I feel more confused than ever. There seem to be no structure or standardizing structure regarding
        functions available. I feel it's just trial and error to get the desired design. Sometime using only css and
        sometime a combination of html and css. I do get the design I want thou. <br>
        During this section I have become much better at using the debugging tools available in my browser. To spot
        errors, refine code and to understand the Dom's inner workings</p>

    <h2>S04</h2>
    <p>I have previously used NPM and Node. Mostly NPM because I have worked with React.JS which is handled by NPM.</p>
    <p>My aim when developing is to have a purpose when I use libraries and frameworks. I see advantages with
        express. It's easy to quickly produce a dynamic site. I am sure there is loads more advantages but as a novice
        I do not know about them yet. Having said this I will try to avoid these kind of
        supporting frameworks for now. Why? Because I want to learn the foundations well before taking shortcuts. I
        believe this will make me a more skilled developer in the end.</p>
    <p>During this course I have really come to accept and like the JS, a language that used to make me anxious. I am
        truly happy that I pressed on in the earlier tasks to push me to learn it. I do however like c/c++ more :-)<br>
        As for Node and Express I see their uses but I leave it at that for now</p>
    <p>My approach was to make grade 3, then 4 and last 5. When done I try to enhance and tidy the code and design.
        In all these assignments I aim for grade 5. I feel that it is challenging to aim at this grade. It takes time to
        solve the grade 4 and 5 tasks but I motivate myself with the knowledge that for every line of code I write I learn
        a little bit more. And that makes it worth all the long hours.</p>
    <p>My main take-aways from this course section is the routing,data-handling and processing in express. It was clean
        and pretty straight forward.</p>

    <h2>S05</h2>
    <p>PHP as a language is similar to use as JSP. The code structure is similar and I had the same challenges in php as
        in JSP. JSP is, however, "closer to home" for me and I would probably use JSP over PHP if I had to choose
        between them. It is server-side and all dynamics is rendered server-side. As a
        consequence all user-initiated page dynamics that can't be solved with css has to be sent to server to rerender
        the page. It is rather provocative to sit and bounce data on the server to solve things that can be done locally
        if I were permitted to use JS. But that in it self is a nice challenge.<br>
        The feeling I get when working with PHP is that it is an older language like Fortran. This is however not correct.
        The language was born in 1994. I read a little bit of how PHP came to be and I suspect that the
        non-standardized evolution in early PHP may tint my experience. The over the top delimiter tags, maybe?
        I cannot put my finger on what factors gives me this feeling of "old" but it is there.</p>
    <p>My aim during this section was to get a 5. My strategy was to design how my solution should work and then produce
        the HTML and PHP to realize it. When I got stuck I searched trough references, forums and examples. The final
        release may not be the most beautiful solution but it works.</p>
    <p>During this section I have gotten more familiar with my server setup and my PHP interpreter as well as the actual
        code. I have glimpsed some techniques to trigger certain behaviors in php and gotten better at debugging php,
        write html and css. I am satisfied with the final result but I will continue to tweak during the rest of the
        course until submission date</p>

    <p><b>Native languages:</b> These languages will always retain their niche due to performance and platform
        interaction capabilities Ex. Delphi, C/C++, Go etc. <br>
        <b>Compiled languages:</b> Compiled languages generally compile to C and then down to assembler/machine. These
        languages often retain some hardware interactions but the implementation is out of the developers control. These
        languages is nice to use if the middle and low-level implementations is beyond the scope of your project but you
        still want the platform compatibility. Ex. Common Lisp, GHC Haskell, Perl<br>
        <b>Interpreted/Scripted:</b> These languages are light and easier to approach than the native ones. The are
        generally platform independent which is a sell point in any business. The are generally abstracted from hardware
        and must utilize native language middleware to interact with hardware efficiently Ex. Java, Python, JavaScript</p>
    <P>My future language will most probably be C/C++. I really like the control I get from using these languages.
        The need to be thorough and extremely vigilant all the time is challenging and keeps me on my toes. Maybe
        I'll also dive into assembler and shader script language along the way</P>
    <p>If I were to do web development I would most probably stay in the backend and use Javascript and PHP but hopefully
        I'll there will be a core somewhere that utilizes C/C++. That would be my work of choice</p>
    <P>My recommendations on languages and framework for an employer would be Javascript/TypeScript/React/Redux.<br>
        Selling points: Javascript can be used front and backend. Typescript is Javascript without errors. and finally
        React/Redux for performance and nice structure.
        All these languages and framework can be used on any platform.
    </P>
    <p>In this section of the course I have reflected on the different approaches to solving specific tasks. Also
        the pros and cons of existing frameworks and how I view them</p>

    <p>.Net is a template system founded on C# and Asp.Net. This makes it easy to quickly produce large, efficient and complex
        websites or applications. These features is probably why this system is gaining popularity in the market.
        With a simple command a skeleton for a website or an application is produced. Multiple options to customize builds
        are available making the initial phase of a project fast and easy</p>
    <P>However, this system is also complex, consists of multiple (non-compatible) versions that makes it hard to find
        good reference material. In my own opinion the references for Java and C/C++ is much better</P>
    <p><b>Personal reflection</b></p>
    <p>I must say that .Net is one of the worst experiences I have had in coding yet. I would rather code assembler than using C#
        and ASP.Net etc.
        I feel confused all the time, the guides and references available doesn't match and I have had a hard time locating
        good solid, working advice online. There doesn't seem to be a general approach how to use .Net in the community.
        It is said that C# came to be as a way to make it easier to code compared to C/C++. Well the result seems worse actually.
        I am not an experienced C/C++ coder but debugging C/C++ is childsplay compared to the tsunamis of BS that is produced using
        this "easier" language. The pros are of course the memory management. But in my opinion, a coder that considers memory
        will be a thorough coder.

    <p>During this section we have analyzed some webpages according to performance. I have used some of the analysis tools
        before but now my analysis was more thorough. The first thing I noticed was that some pages would download
        pretty fast but was slow to render. Others would take more time to download but were interactive as soon
        as download was complete.</p>
    <p>One of the sites analysed was one of my servers. The report suggested that I should use different image formats and
        remove unused css references. The performance gain would not be that great but a little bit. What I noticed
        was that response time and download speed was good. This is nice to hear because the server in question is running
        on a system with limited resources. I have been fearing that this would have a large impact. This data says otherwise.</p>
    <p>During this section I have been taking mental notes of how to avoid bottlenecking in my code. To enable vital code
        to load first and then incrementally add on functionality as the data becomes available. This produces a fast site that
        will have functionality with only partially loaded page.</p>
    <P>Members: Isak Zayane, Oscar Odelstav, Simon Westerdahl and Fredrik Lémon Larsson.
        The data collected: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wnIwN9Sp8wWEU1myFZWR4r_xUvVyk82/view
        The pages compared are GitLab, which is hosted on Fredrik's server, Androids Developer page, and Wikipedia.
        Overall Wikipedia has the best time on each time measure. If you compare AndroidDev and Wikipedia, which both
        is for documentation but AndroidDev finished 100 times slower than Wikipedia. One could argue that AndroidDev
        should apply a wiki instead of their layout, to get better overall speed time. The AndroidDev is also about 10
        times slower on first CPU idle time, so their page will not be as quickly responsive as wikipedia either.
        We chose Fredrik’s GitLab page just to see its response time for curiosity. Since it’s hosted on a server in
        Fredriks garage its surprising that it finishes 10 times faster than AndroidDev. Since AndroidDev got
        established business servers in comparison to Fredriks server. However measuring GitLab we only measured the
        first login page and not further into the site. When logged in you might see slower speed since there is more
        security as you log in. The GitLab and Android Devs First Input Delay (FID) are 1.78  and 0.59  seconds
        respectively. Going above 2-3 seconds can be too long for a user to have a pleasant experience, whilst
        Wikipedia's FID is 0.05, which is splendid!
        An important metric in the performance section is Time to Interactive. Wikipedia, having the best time at 0.7
        seconds while GitLab and AndroidDe have 8.4 and 14.5 seconds respectively. Having 14.5 seconds on TTI is not
        good at all and users might end up using other sources than AndroidDev while for example looking up guides
        for Android Studio.</P>

    <h2>S09</h2>
    <p>Implement https. Today this is almost a necessity but it's worth to be reminded. Using secure transfer makes
        your data private during transfer. It is still good practice to not push user-credentials in "clear-text" even on
        a secure connection.</p>
    <P>Libraries is something most developers use frequently. Most of the time the are linked via Maven. But it is
        not common to review used libraries for security flaws och back-doors. I recently read an article about
        security issues within common libraries. Some flaws were just bugs. But some were deliberately inserted.
        To review included libraries is not something commonly performed in industry and this is a huge problem.
        The next best thing if not reviewing a library is to use well-known libraries/frameworks. Due to many users
        errors within these libraries/frameworks should be spotted earlier and removed. But there is never a guaranty</P>
    <p>Speaking of libraries and frameworks. Until you know how to implement proper security by yourself it is best
        practice to use libraries and framework for this task. You will probably end up with better security than
        implementing by hand. Remember, an attacker need only one hole. You need to find all the holes...</p>
    <p>Last but not least, never ever ever use a development environment for production. A dev environment is configured
        to make it easy to implement your site/software. But this also makes it easy for the hacker. Some popular servers
        have had to implement some default security in their development environment due to the fact that many put the
        server online in development configuration with disastrous consequences</p>
    <p>I have been hosting 3 servers for some years and most of the server-side problems discussed was not new to me.
        But the part about sessions and tokens is interesting. I haven't implemented this kind of security on any website/app
        yet. We will probably do it in our project.</p>
