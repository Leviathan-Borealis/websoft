    <h2>S01</h2>
    <p>I have prior experience and feel experienced in GIT. I have been hosting a GitLab server since 2,5years and been the main code administrator
        during past years.
        GitHub: Yes, some experience. Haven't used it that much due to using my own server
        I have only limited experience of markdown.
        I have some previous experience with GitHub pages but only limited

        I have some previous experience in creating websites. Both in pure HTML/Flash and in HTML/CSS/JS(React/TypeScript)

        I would describe my previous experience as limited regarding web development.
        The Dynamic typing and working with UI feels challenging and confusing.

        Today I learned about some new frameworks and techniques regarding web-development.</p>

    <h2>S02</h2>
    <p>I do have prior experience with HTML, JS and CSS but have usually used React.JS to develop websites.
        On top of that I haven't really made any attempt to deep-dive into it. Web-development have always been an anxiety for me.
        Today I have been playing and debugging with CSS, both inline and in stylesheet.
        I relly do still experience confusion when it comes to web-development. It seems unstructured when compared to "normal"
        development.</p>
