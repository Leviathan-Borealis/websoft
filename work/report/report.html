    <p>I have prior experience and feel experienced in GIT. I have been hosting a GitLab server since 2,5years and been the main code administrator
        during past years.<br>
        GitHub: Yes, some experience. Haven't used it that much due to using my own server<br>
        I have only limited experience of markdown. I can get around but I do not know it by heart<br>
        I have some previous experience with GitHub pages but only limited<br>
        I have some previous experience in creating websites. Both in pure HTML/Flash and in HTML/CSS/JS(React/TypeScript)<br>
        I would describe my previous experience as limited regarding web development.
        The dynamic typing used in JS and working with UX/UI feels challenging and sometimes confusing.
        Today I learned about some new frameworks and techniques regarding web-development.</p>

    <h2>S02</h2>
    <p>A short description of what makes a web page: HTML gives the page its structure, what goes where, where resources can be found etc.
        CSS fine-tunes how different elements of the page is visualised, interacts with other element and how they should respond to triggered events.
        Javascript provides dynamic to the page. Fetching of remote data, filtering data and calculations are some common implementations.
    </p>
    <p>I do have prior experience with HTML, JS and CSS but have usually used React.JS to develop websites.
        On top of that I haven't really made any attempt to deep-dive into it. Web-development have always been an anxiety for me.
        During this section I have been playing and debugging with CSS, both inline and in stylesheet.
        I really do still experience confusion when it comes to web-development. It seems unstructured when compared to "normal"
        development.</p>
    <p>A short description of browser - HTTP - web server interaction:<br>
        A user request a web page via a browser. The browser connects to the web server via a HTTP GET. The web server looks
        for the resource specified in the GET from the browser. If found the web server responds to the browser with the requested data and the return code 200.
        Upon receiving the data (string of html) from web server the browser searches the received html for external resources referenced.
        The browser performs request for these resources and when all resources are locally(there are exceptions to this of course) the page will be showed fro the user</p>
