    <h2>S01</h2>
    <p>I have prior experience and feel experienced in GIT. I have been hosting a git-server since 2,5years and been the main code administrator
        during past projects. Of course I do not know everything but I have enough knowledge to find solutions to the more advanced problems when they arise.<br>
        GitHub: Yes, some experience. I also have som e experience using GitLab. Haven't used either of them that much due to I have been using my own git-server.<br>
        I have only limited experience of markdown. I get around and know the basics but I do not know it by heart<br>
        I have some previous experience with GitHub pages but only limited of the same reason as stated above<br>
        I do have some previous experience in creating websites. Both in pure HTML/Flash and in HTML/CSS/JS(React/TypeScript). As stated before, I have some knowledge but its
        just the basics.</p>
    <p>I would describe my previous experience in web development as overall limited. I get things done but it takes some time and research due to
        lack of experience and knowledge.
        Why haven't I developed that much for web? The dynamic typing in JS is confusing for me that normally use C/C++ and Android/Java.
        And when working with UX/UI I often find myself lacking ideas for design.</p>
    <p>Today I learned about some new frameworks and techniques used for web-development. As I said before,
        its a jungle out there. And there is always something new...</p>

    <p>A short description of what makes a web page: HTML gives the page its structure, what goes where, where resources can be found etc.
        CSS fine-tunes how different elements of the page is visualised, interacts with other element and how they should respond to triggered events.
        Javascript provides dynamic to the page. Fetching of remote data, filtering data and calculations are some common implementations.</p>
    <p>I do have prior experience with HTML, JS and CSS but have lately used React.JS and Typescript to develop websites.
        On top of that I haven't really made any attempt to deep-dive into it. Web-development have always been an anxiety for me.
        I really do still experience confusion when it comes to web-development. It seems unstructured when compared to "normal"
        development.</p>
    <p>During this section I have been playing and debugging with CSS, both inline and in stylesheet. This work with CSS and JS has had the consequence
        that I have learned som new techniques to implement the desired effect on components.</p>
    <p>A short description of browser - HTTP - web server interaction:<br>
        A user request a web page via a browser. The browser connects to the web server via a HTTP GET. The web server looks
        for the resource specified in the GET from the browser. If found the web server responds to the browser with the requested data and the return code 200.
        Upon receiving the data (string of html) from web server the browser searches the received html for external resources referenced.
        The browser performs request for these resources and when all resources are locally(there are exceptions to this of course) the page will be showed fro the user</p>
