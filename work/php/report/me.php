            <p><img class="in_feed_img" src="img/me.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

            <p>My name is Fredrik Lemón Larsson. I am 39 years old, soon to turn 40.
                I am married to Linda and we have 3 kids.
                Idun is the oldest. She is 6. Our twins Atle and Eira are 4. We live east of Kristianstad and north of Bromölla in an area called Norreskog.

            Before I started study to become a software developer I worked as a Naval officer in the Royal Swedish navy.
                I served for 19 years during which I've piloted helicopters, operated large ships and handled small fast boats
            I have also experienced the joy of winning and the trauma of loosing under circumstances many do not experience. I believe this is both a blessing and a curse
            In general I have guided, taught and instructed 500 to 700 students per year and I have really come to like the teaching.
                I hope I can continue using this ability in my future.</p>

            <p>My hobbies are woodwork, coding and renovating things. But most of my spare time is spent with my children and family</p>
