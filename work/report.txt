I have prior experience and feel experienced in GIT. I have been hosting a git-server since 2,5years and been
the main code administrator during past projects. Of course I do not know everything but I have enough knowledge to
find solutions to the more advanced problems when they arise.

GitHub: Yes, some experience. I also have som e experience using GitLab. Haven't used either of them that much due to
I have been using my own git-server.

Markdown:
I have only limited experience of markdown. I get around and know the basics but I do not know it by heart

GitHub pages:
I have some previous experience with GitHub pages but only limited of the same reason as stated above

Creating web pages:
I do have some previous experience in creating websites. Both in pure HTML/Flash and in HTML/CSS/JS(React/TypeScript).
As stated before, I have some knowledge but it's just the basics.

I would describe my previous experience in web development as overall limited. I get things done but it takes some time
and research due to lack of experience and knowledge. Why haven't I developed that much for web? The dynamic typing in
JS is confusing for me that normally use C/C++ and Android/Java. And when working with UX/UI I often find myself
lacking ideas for design.

Today I learned about some new frameworks and techniques used for web-development. As I said before,
its a jungle out there. And there is always something new...
